##Non-Academia
###Titration PH
Analyzes a stepwise titration according to a pH curve.

###Lit - CDB! Generator
Based on the convention of the [children's book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDB!), where each syllable of a word in the English language can be represented as the pronunciation of a single letter. Converting multi-syllable words into hyphenated letters is also necessary for more unique scenarios as well. Two examples are below:

- A simple one:
>See the bee!
>>C D B

- A more complex one:
>I am a human being. You are an animal.
>>I M A U-M B-N. U R N N-M-L.

###AI Assignment No. 3
Create a solver for the [Perceptrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons) scenario, demonstrating the ability of learning.
* Implementation ( **done - may need rewrite** )

###AI Assignment No. 2
Create a solver for the [N Queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Queens) scenario, using four different AI methods:

* Stochastic Beam Search ( **done** )
* Hill Climbing ( **done** )
* Simulated Annealing ( **done** )
* Genetic Algorithm ( **done** )

The compiled program is a Linux binary written in C. As it is simplistic and unreliant on other platform APIs, though, it is possible to run it in Windows via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).

###AI Assignment No. 1
Create a solver for [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac_Toe), using a simple heuristics method. In addition, be sure to use the generating of a game tree with a minimax algorithm to solve scenarios.
* Assignment status (**done**)

The compiled .jar is able to be run on all platforms with the simple command _java -jar Tic-Tac-Toe.jar_
