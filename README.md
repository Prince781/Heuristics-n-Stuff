Heuristics 'n Stuff
===================

##Assignment No. 3
Create a solver for the [Perceptrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons) scenario, demonstrating the ability of learning.
* Implementation ( **done - may need rewrite** )

##Assignment No. 2
Create a solver for the [N Queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Queens) scenario, using four different AI methods:

* Stochastic Beam Search ( **done** )
* Hill Climbing ( **done** )
* Simulated Annealing ( **done** )
* Genetic Algorithm ( **done** )

The compiled program is a Linux binary written in C. As it is simplistic and unreliant on other platform APIs, though, it is possible to run it in Windows via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).

##Assignment No. 1
Create a solver for [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac_Toe), using a simple heuristics method. In addition, be sure to use the generating of a game tree with a minimax algorithm to solve scenarios.

* Entire Project ( **done** )

The compiled .jar is able to be run on all platforms with the simple command _java -jar Tic-Tac-Toe.jar_
