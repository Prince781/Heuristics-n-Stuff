Heuristics 'n Stuff

#Assignment No. 2
Create a solver for the [N Queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Queens) scenario, using four different AI methods:

* Stochastic Beam Search (**todo**)
* Hill Climbing (**started**)
* Simulated Annealing (**todo**)
* Genetic Algorithm (**todo**)

The compiled program is a Linux binary written in C. As it is simplistic and unreliant on other platform APIs, though, it is possible to run it in Windows via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).
